This is an Form I/O object based on the [@wonderlandlabs/forest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wonderlandlabs/forest) 
state management system. It is analogous to Formik; notable
differences are that functionality and validation are distributed to the field objects themselves, and the functionality
and rendering are not bound in the same solution set.

## The General Idea 

A Form is a collection of 1 or more *fields*. Each one has a value, and tests that emit errors
if the value is not valid. The Form instance can only be submitted when all of its fields
are valid. 

Forms are locked when the form is submitted. 



## From the bottom up: Forest-io fields

Forest-io forms are based on a series of field definitions. Each field is defined with the following properties:

* **name**: the name of the field
* **value**: the initial value of the field
* **validator**: an optional function to return/throw errors on invalid values
* **data**: an optional object with any other values (title, selector options, etc.)
  that you want to attach to fields; for example, display label, etc.

### Validators in depth

A validator function indicates a value is "valid" by returning a falsy value (undefined, null, etc.); A validator can
indicate falsiness by either throwing an error or returning a string.

Validator functions are passed `(value, fieldLeaf]`.

Validators are optional.

Validators do not BLOCK the change of a fields' value; they only affect the validation indicators (below)
that describe the valid state of the field.

### Fields' values

A fields value is (way way) more data than the actual input value

each fields' value includes the following values:

* **value**: the current fields' value
* **locked**: (boolean) whether the field has been locked
* **touched**: (boolean) whether the field's value has _ever_ been changed from its initial value
* **show**: (boolean) a UX utility for showing / hiding the form element; true by default
* **form**: (Form) a reference to its parent form
* **$initialValue**: the value of the field when created
* **$isValid**: (boolean) whether any errors have been returned by the validator function; true if no validator function
* **$error**: (var) any error returned/thrown from the validator function; falsy if no validator exists.
* **$errorMessage**: (string | other) attempts to "unpack" the message field of $error if possible.
* **$isLocked**: either the field _or its form_ has been locked.

also, fields' name property is set from the constructor where available. 

Fields have the following actions:

* **update(value)**: set the next field value
* **updateWithEvent(event)**: set the next field value to event.target.value; useful for form / input UX
* **setLocked(boolean)**: selectively locks the field.
* **setShow(boolean)**: updates the show value of the field.
* **reset(toValue?)**: resets touched; if toValue is passed, sets the fields' value to it; otherwise uses the initial value

## Form

A form is a collection of fields.

```javascript

const form = new Form('greeks', {
  alpha: {
    value: 1, validator(value) {
      if (typeof value !== 'number') throw new Error('value must be a number');
    }
  },
  beta: {value: 2},
}, (fieldValues) => {
  return axios.post('/my/api', values);
});

```

Form values have the following fields: 

* **fields**: an object containing the name/value pairs for each field
* **$status**: reflects whether the form has been submitted; 
  can be one of the following:  'form:editing', 'form:submitting', 'form:saved', 'form:error';
* **$isValid**: (boolean) whether any errors have been returned by the validator function; true if no validator function
* **$error**: (var) any error returned/thrown from the validator function; falsy if no validator exists.
* **$errorMessage**: (string | other) attempts to "unpack" the message field of $error if possible.
* **$isLocked**: if the form has been locked.
* **$summary**: a digest of the fields' values in object form. 

Forms have the following actions:

* **submit()**: sends the $summary through to the onSubmit handler; updates status, and returns a promise reflecting submission status.
  If you call this method without any onSubmit function being set, the form will be locked permanantly in the FORM_SUBMITTING
  state, and the form fields will be locked; it will be up to you to interpret and adjust the status. 
* **setLocked(boolean)**: locks all fields from being changed. Locking happens automatically when the submit() promise is active. 
* **reset()**: sets all fields' values to their initial value;
* **updateField(name, value)**: a passthrough to a fields' update;
* **update({name: value,....")**: update multiple fields at once.
* **field(name)**: returns the field (or form) Leaf from the fields branch.
* **addField(name, value, validator = undefined, def = {})**: adds a field to the Form definition. 
* **remField(name)**: removes a field from the fields branch.
* **addSubForm(name, fields, onSubmit = null, validate = null)**: adds a form to the fields' collection.

### Locking Fields and Forms

Individual fields can be *locked* to prevent value update from working. Additionally, 
you can lock the entire form, preventing any of its fields from being updated. Lastly, 
submitting a form locks it; this is a reflection of the forms' *status* property. 

## form.do.submit() in detail

Form status is one of the following:

* `form:editing` -- unlocks fields for change
* `form:sumbitting` -- while data is on the way
* `form:saved` -- when the transmission has been completed
* `form:error` -- if the transmission is unsuccessful. 

calling `myForm.do.submit()` returns a promise that wraps the onSubmit function passed
as the third argument to the Form constructor. It will get a summary of the fields' values.
Actual REST transport of the data is the responsibility of the developer. 

the onSubmit function is stored in your form instance's `res` (resource) collection. 
If you want to stub another function into the form you can replace the handler by calling
`myInstance.res('onSubmit', stubFunction)` - this will inject your stubFunction
into your form instance. 

### pairing field I/0 with a form: 

The easiest way to adapt UX to a form's fields is to pass through the updateFromEvent action of each field:

```jsx
<input type="text" value={formLeaf.branch('fields.alpha').value.value} 
       onChange={ formLeaf.branch('fields.alpha').do.updateFromEvent} />
```
Its also quite easy to pass the field branch (`myForm.branch('fields.alpha')`) to a component designed to extract
these actions/values in a general pattern. 

```jsx
const BranchInput = ({branch}) => (
  <div> 
    <label>{branch.name}</label>
    <input type="text" value={branch.value.value}
           onChange={ branch.do.updateFromEvent} />
  </div>
)

const MyComponent = ({form}) => (
  <>
    <BranchInput branch={form.branch('fields.alpha')} />
    <BranchInput branch={form.branch('fields.beta')} />
  </>
)

```

## Adding Sub-forms 

Forms can be nested in the fields' collection; this is useful to represent a wizard or a nested data structure,
in which the parent form is composed of sub-values. 

This requires post-constructor modification of the form. 

```javascript

  const wizard = new Form('wizard', { name: { value: 'foo' } });
  wizard.do.addSubForm('address', {
    city: { value: '' },
    state: { value: '' },
  });
  wizard.do.addSubForm('contact', {
    email: {
      value: '',
      validator: value => {
        if (typeof value !== 'string') {
          return 'value must be a string';
        }
        if (!/.+@.+\..+/.test(value)) {
          return 'not a proper email';
        }
        return false;
      },
    },
    phone: { value: '' },
  });

```

The implication of "submitting" a sub-form is ambiguous; other than locking the fields of the form, it doesn't trigger 
the onSubmit() of the parent form or affect the parent forms' status in any other way. Its advised not to call 
sub-forms' `do.submit()` method at all.
